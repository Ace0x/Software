    <article class="ArticleExample">
        <h3 class="SubT">article-Article</h3>
        <h3>This header is inside an article</h3>
        <p>The <article> HTML element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, 
            application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable 
            (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article,
             or a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, 
             or any other independent item of content.
        </p>
        <p>essentially a div but with a purpose in life</p>
    </article>
    <section>
        <h3 class="SubT">section-Section</h3>
        <h3>This header is inside a section</h3>
        <p>The section HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a document, 
            which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections 
            should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.</p>
    </section>
    <span class="SpanExample">
        <h3 class="SubT">span-Span</h3>
        <h3>This header is inside a span</h3>
        <p>generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently 
            represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes 
            (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. 
            It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. </p>
    </span>
    <h3 class="SubT">strong-Strong</h3>
    <strong>This text is strong, or just bold (represents an important word or words. It essentially does the same thing as bold but the strong tag represents importance)</strong>
    <h3 class="SubT">br-Break</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Notice how there's a space there? Yeah that's a break</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="SubT">i-Italics</h3>
    <i>This text is smooth...just like my brain (italics)</i>
    <br>
    <h3 class="SubT">u-underline</h3>
    <u>This text is supported or just underlined lmao</u>
    <h3 class="SubT">b-Bold</h3>
    <b>This text is offset text that is styled in bold</b>
    <br>
    <h3 class="SubT">strike-Strike</h3>
    <p>Crossing out</p>
    <p>Kill confirmed</p><strike>Andrew</strike>
    <br>
    <h3 class="SubT">small-Small</h3>
    <small>I'm small and used to represent small prints or side contents</small>
    <br>
    <h3 class="SubT">em-Emphasis</h3>
    <em>Emphasis dude!, Emphasis on the text. The tag determines that there should be Emphasis in this text (or italics 2.0)</em>    
    <h3 class="SubT">header-Header</h3>
    <p>HTML element that represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. 
        It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.</p>
    <header>This is introductory content, or so said the teacher before failing me</header>
    <h3 class="SubT">aside-Aside</h3>
    <p>Text that follows accompanies something</p>
    <p>HTML element that represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.</p>
